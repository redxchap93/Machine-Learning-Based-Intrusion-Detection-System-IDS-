# Machine-Learning-Based-Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that uses machine learning to monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats in real-time
Detailed Project Explanation
This project involves developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that uses machine learning to monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats in real-time. It integrates concepts from cybersecurity, networking, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, providing a comprehensive learning experience.

Overview
An Intrusion Detection System is a critical component in cybersecurity, designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and alert administrators of potential threats. By leveraging machine learning, the IDS can learn from network patterns and improve its detection capabilities over time.

Prerequisites

Knowledge Requirements:
Basic understanding of Python programming.
Familiarity with networking concepts such as IP addresses, protocols, and packet structure.
Introductory knowledge of machine learning concepts, particularly supervised learning and decision trees.
Software Requirements:
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, scapy, and joblib.
Step 1: Setting Up the Development Environment
Objective: Prepare your system with the necessary tools and libraries to develop and run the IDS.

Install Python 3.x: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. This is the primary programming language used for the project.
Install Required Libraries:
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
scapy: For network packet manipulation and sniffing.
joblib: For model serialization (saving and loading models).
Step 2: Capturing Network Traffic
Objective: Collect network data that will be used to train and test the machine learning model.

Network Packet Capture:
Use a network packet capturing tool (like Scapy) to sniff network traffic on your machine.
Capture a sufficient number of packets (e.g., 1000 packets) to have a representative dataset.
Data Storage:
Store the captured packets in a file format (such as PCAP) for later analysis and feature extraction.
Ethical Considerations:
Ensure you have the right and permission to capture network traffic on the network you are using. Unauthorized network monitoring is illegal.
Step 3: Extracting and Preprocessing Data

Objective: Process the captured network data to extract meaningful features and prepare it for machine learning.

Feature Extraction:
Read the captured packets from the PCAP file.
Extract relevant features from each packet, such as:
Source IP Address: Identifies the sender of the packet.
Destination IP Address: Identifies the receiver of the packet.
Protocol: The protocol used (e.g., TCP, UDP).
Packet Length: The size of the packet.
Data Structuring:
Organize the extracted features into a structured format, such as a table or dataframe, where each row represents a packet and each column represents a feature.
Data Labeling:

Assign labels to each packet indicating whether it is normal or malicious traffic.
Since collecting actual malicious traffic may not be feasible, simulate malicious traffic by randomly labeling a small percentage (e.g., 10%) of the packets as malicious.
Data Encoding:

Convert categorical data (like IP addresses and protocols) into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Use techniques such as categorical encoding or mapping to numerical codes.
Data Saving:

Save the processed and labeled data into a file format (e.g., CSV) for use in model training.
Step 4: Building the Machine Learning Model

Objective: Develop and train a machine learning model that can classify network packets as normal or malicious.

Data Preparation:
Load the preprocessed data.
Separate the data into features (inputs) and labels (outputs).
Features (X): The columns representing the packet attributes.
Labels (y): The column representing the classification (normal or malicious).
Train-Test Split:
Divide the dataset into a training set and a testing set (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
Model Selection:
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm. For this project, a Decision Tree Classifier is selected due to its simplicity and interpretability.
Model Training:

Train the Decision Tree model using the training data.

The model learns patterns and relationships between the features and the labels.
Model Evaluation:

Use the testing data to evaluate the model’s performance.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess how well the model classifies packets.
Analyze the results to identify any overfitting or underfitting issues.
Model Saving:

Save the trained model to a file using serialization (e.g., with joblib), so it can be loaded later for real-time detection.
Step 5: Implementing Real-Time Intrusion Detection
Objective: Integrate the trained machine learning model into a system that can monitor network traffic in real-time and detect intrusions.

Real-Time Packet Sniffing:
Set up a real-time packet capture mechanism using Scapy.
Continuously monitor network traffic and capture packets as they arrive.
Packet Processing:

For each captured packet, extract the same features used during model training.

Encode any categorical data as done previously.
Intrusion Detection:

Load the trained machine learning model.
Use the model to predict whether each packet is normal or malicious based on its features.
If a packet is classified as malicious, trigger an alert or log the event.
System Output:

Provide real-time feedback by printing alerts to the console or writing to a log file.
Indicate clearly when an intrusion is detected versus normal traffic.
Performance Considerations:
Ensure the real-time detection system is efficient and does not significantly impact network performance.
Optimize code and use efficient data structures to handle high volumes of traffic if necessary.
Step 6: Testing the IDS
Objective: Validate the functionality and effectiveness of the Intrusion Detection System.

System Testing:
Run the IDS and generate network traffic by performing typical online activities (e.g., browsing websites, streaming videos).
Observe the system’s outputs to verify that normal traffic is correctly classified.
Intrusion Simulation:

Simulate malicious activities if possible, such as port scanning or sending malformed packets, to test if the IDS correctly detects intrusions.
Alternatively, manipulate test packets to resemble malicious traffic based on known attack patterns.
Evaluation:

Assess the system’s accuracy in detecting intrusions and its false positive rate.
Identify any misclassifications and analyze possible reasons (e.g., insufficient training data, feature selection).
Refinement:

Based on the evaluation, consider refining the model:
Collect more representative data.
Experiment with different algorithms or model parameters.
Enhance feature extraction methods.
Step 7: Documenting the Project
Objective: Create comprehensive documentation to explain the project, its implementation, and usage.

Code Documentation:
Add comments and docstrings in the code to explain the functionality of functions, classes, and significant code blocks.
Ensure that the code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
